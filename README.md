## Hi there! I'm Futya üëã


I'm a developer driven by **algorithmic curiosity**, constantly seeking to understand the foundational logic behind robust systems. I specialize in building solutions across the stack, prioritizing **clean architecture** and problem-solving over framework loyalty.

### üíª My Toolkit & Expertise

My experience is focused on foundational languages and includes proficiency in modern frameworks:

| Category | Skills & Frameworks |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Foundational** | Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, **PHP** |
| **Frameworks** | **Vue.js** (Frontend), **Laravel** (Backend) |
| **Concepts** | Algorithms (like Shunting-Yard!), Data Structures, Clean Architecture |
| **Version Control** | Git, GitHub |
| **Databases** | [e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite] |

### üß† Featured Project Spotlight: Shunting-Yard Calculator

This project showcases my commitment to reliable solutions built from the ground up:

> I built a full calculator that avoids the built-in `eval()` function, instead implementing the **Shunting-Yard Algorithm** to correctly enforce mathematical **precedence and parentheses**. This demonstrates a deep understanding of core algorithmic logic.

### üöÄ What I'm Focused On

I thrive on solving complex problems and following my curiosity. My current focus areas are:

- **Algorithmic Depth:** Deepening my understanding of core computer science principles to write highly efficient code.
- **Architectural Exploration:** Experimenting with clean, modular design across the stack, ensuring solutions are robust and scalable.
- **Continuous Learning:** Exploring new challenges and integrating new technologies where curiosity leads me next.
